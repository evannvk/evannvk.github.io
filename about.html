        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Evan Novak. I have been trained by a group of highly
          skilled developers in an intensive full-stack Java bootcamp in 2020
          possessing the skills to work efficiently in a team and individually
          to design and create programs. The development skills I have include:
          Java • Spring • Hibernate • JPA • JavaScript • MVC • HTML • CSS •
          Flexbox • Grid • TDD • Agile (Scrum) • Object Oriented Programming
          (OOP) • AJAX • JSON • Restful APIs • Responsive Design / Mobile •
          Structured Query Language (SQL) • Relational Databases • Source
          Control / Git<br />
          <br />
          I see myself becoming a senior developer at the peak of my career,
          tackling new software languages as the industry adapts, changes and
          grows. Software development is an exciting challenge in an constantly
          growing industry of technology that has peaked my interest since I was
          very young. The idea of giving people the chance to do something they
          never thought they could before is what’s most exciting about the idea
          of software development.<br />
          <br />
          In my spare time I enjoy photography, listening to my vinyl records,
          and eating the best comfort food I can find.
